New datastructures in SPL
16.01.2008

New datastructures made their way into SPL recently:

* _SplDoublyLinkedList_

as long with two childs:

* _SplStack_
* _SplQueue_

Those structures implement _Iterator_, _ArrayAccess_ and _Countable_ which makes them easy to handle. There are also multiple ways to iterate through them.

More datastructures will get implemented in the future. The goal is to implement quite every basic datastructure along with algorithms related to them. _SPL_ could then be used as an object oriented  replacement for _ADT_.
