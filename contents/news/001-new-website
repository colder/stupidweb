New website available
10.05.2005

Here we go ! I'm happy to present you my new website. You probably feel a bit disappointed and I can understand that: the new design is completely different. I'll probably take the time to create a skin looking like the old website.

This new website is still under construction but the main work is done.  I've made this new design thinking about two problem that occurred in the last one : shortage of place and the excessive weight of the images. As you can see, this design uses few images and its width is not fixed.

About the main system used behind: I changed the way I linked the pages, I used output buffering to have more control on the output but also to have control on the meta information that became dynamic. I also use a skin system using templates and CSS. Notice that I plan a "My settings" section where you'll be able to configure your own view of this website.

A repository system is also implemented to handle my php scripts, publications, school files and images. I'll fill it when I find the time.

I hope you'll enjoy.
