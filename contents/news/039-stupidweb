This stupid website
22.02.2012

I completely rewrote the system that renders this website. For fun I implemented
the following features that strive for simplicity:

 *  File based, no database, tracked by git
 *  Online interface to edit
 *  Renders markdown content
 *  post-update hook so that I can edit my website locally and publish on push

The system is also publicly available on [github](https://github.com/colder/stupidweb)!
