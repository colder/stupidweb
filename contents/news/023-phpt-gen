PHPT Generator used to discover documentation problems
06.12.2006

I commited a patch to docweb, some days back, to allow the generation of the complete package of phpt files. Those phpt files were generated from doc examples.

The main use of those phpt files was to have an easy way to check examples used in the documentation. Along with a [/repository/php/php.net/docweb/analyzeTestResults.php php script analyzing the results] and Hannes' great testing environment, I was able to generate a summary of the examples failing:

The [/repository/php/php.net/docweb/phpt_results.txt?raw results] are quite interresting:
# 251 tests were generated
# 126 (50%) passed the checks
# 23 (9%) tests failed because of a missing extension
# 102 (41%) tests failed because of an error in the example (11% of them were caused by whitespace issues only)

There is thus potentially 80-90 examples in the documentation that contain errors!

Let the massive example bug squashing party begin !
